We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25 Joke's on you, we still alive Throw your hands up in the sky and say: We don't care what people say If this is your first time hearin' this You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man Flickin' Starter coats, man Man, you don't know, man We don't care what people say This is for my niggas outside all winter Cause this summer they ain't finna say: next summer I'm finna Sittin' in the hood like community colleges This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55 And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up We put shit on layaway, then come back We claim other people kids on our income tax We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid And we don't care what people say Momma say she wanna move South Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house 'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work He figured he'd take work The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake And we don't care what people say You know the kids gon' act a fool When you stop the programs for after school And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic They favorite 50 Cent song 12 Questions We scream: rocks, blow, weed, park, see, now we smart We ain't retards, the way teachers thought Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class Sad enough we on welfare They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us But we don't care what people say My niggas"

And I can't even go to the grocery store Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team It seems we living the american dream But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem The prettiest people do the ugliest things For the road to riches and diamond rings We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us We trying to buy back our 40 acres And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em Things we buy to cover up what's inside Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth That's why shortys hollering where the ballas' at? Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack And a white man get paid off of all of that But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou Before I had a house and I'd do it again Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific I got a problem with spending before I get it We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down"

While I'm smoking on a B\
Dipping through the streets\
Bumping R&B\
And I got to leave\
something to the 23's?\
And I do it (well well well well well)\
With my earth and the wind smoke a fire\
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat\
Put you in a daze for maze\
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex\
You ready for the world girl\
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me\
An every moment you controllin' me I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci\
And when I come over and bend your ass\
You be bumping Teddy Pendergrass\
I'd hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow\
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'm gonna finish last\
No matter how much of a thug you see\
I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me\
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and still be in love with me\
\
Baby drop another slow jam\
And all us lovers need hold hands\
And if you ain't got no man hop up in my Brougham\
I keep it pimping like an old man\
You got to roll with the plan\
Cause after that then I\
Take it to the dome\
Then I got to bone\
Stay up in the zone\
Got to get you home\
Gotta run up on\
And I do it (well well well well well)\
Baby drop another slow jam\
And all us lovers need hold hands\
And if you ain't got no man hop up on my brohem\
I keep it pimping like an old man\
You got to roll with the plan\
Cause after that then I\
Take you to my home\
And we could get it on\
Disconnect the phone\
Just to get you goin'\
Trying to make you moan\
And I do it (well well well well well)"

If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out\
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out\
Breathe in, breathe out\
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out\
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out!\
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap\
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)\
But is it cool to rap about gold\
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)\
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack\
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack\
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant\
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again\
And it's still about the Benjamins\
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms\
Strippers named Cinnamon\
More chips than Pentium\
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is\
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks\
And I'm so broke I look back like Damn, was I on crack?\
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?\
What the hell was wrong with me dog?\
Sing along with my y'all\
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out\
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\

If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out!\
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick\
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick\
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this\
And givin' head is like a whale, using the toothpick\
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time\
Act now and get some action for $free.99\
Later on I might charge for ménage\
Heard her man was the boss of the floss\
But she still want to toss me the drawers\
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy\
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club\
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug\
She asked Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?\
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man\
Baby I fully understand\
Let me help you with a plan\
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga\
Give ME some head, that'll really piss I'm off\
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out\
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out\
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out\
Breathe in, breathe out\
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out\
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\
When I pull a piece out niggas like Peace out!\
I blow past low class niggas with no cash\
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask\
So when I go fast popo just laugh\
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash\
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst\
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon\
Pullin' up in the Lexuses/'lexeses, one on both hand\
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous\
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages\
K I need a free hand mammogram\
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam\
All of which is legal in Amsterdam\
So say my name like Candyman\
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman\
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave\
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe\
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out\
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out\
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out\
Breathe in, breathe out\
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out\
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\

picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him\
I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do\
I play the songs, he's like Who that spittin?\
I'm like It's me. He's like Oh, well okay.\
Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone\
going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats\
And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers\
cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with\
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID\
And No ID told him, look man, you wanna mess with Kanye\
you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\
[No ID:] Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not\
but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\
[Hiphop:] I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\
I'm like oh shit\
I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also\
People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production\
But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here\
So you know. After they picked that Truth beat\
I was figuring I was gonna do some more work\
But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago\
I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts\
just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy\
get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something\
or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\
I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample\
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like oh, yo that shit is crazy\
Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.\
And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me\
so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time\
and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like\
with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style\
when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'\
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album\
I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound\
You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time\
I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with\
Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm\
sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did\
for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he\
gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I\
came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, oh\
you a real soulful dude [Jay-Z: you a real soulful dude]. And he\
uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got\
to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said\
[Jay-Z:] check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\
tell me what you think of this. And I heard it, and I was thinking\
like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't\
want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my\
personal opinion. So he asked me, what you think of it?\
[Jay-Z:] so what you thinkin?\
And I was like, man that shit tite,\
you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train\
man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just\
in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got\
acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like\
poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one\
of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through\
my production company, but he ended up going straight with the\
company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad\
news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at\
the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took\
that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about\
ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal\
with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to\
[Mother:] Come on, let's just go\
Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.\
I remember I pulled up\
[Mother:] Kanye, baby, we're here,\
I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a\
bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and\
the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'\
And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up\
there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I\
played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone\
he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at\
that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket\
hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said\
yo play that one beat for him. And I played 'Heart of the City.' And\
really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\
[Hiphop:] No I think Jay gon' like this one right here.\
And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that\
GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of\
them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen\
Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like yo what's up I'm Kanye.\
[Dame:] Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\
You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?\
Yo, this nigga got classics\
[Dame:] Jay got classics, G.\
You know I ain't talkin shit.\
I'm like oh shit. And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm\
still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show\
The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my\
eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all\
these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one\
thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be\
Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton\
sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John\
Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the\
time they was in the room, and I said, yo Jay I could rap. And I\
spit this rap that said, uh I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical\
shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips. And I saw his\
eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap\
was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.\
He said man that was tite.\
[Jay-Z:] That, that was cool. That was hot.\
That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.\
Okay, fast forward.\
So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just\
took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship\
with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my\
career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me\
to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at\
this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had\
relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so\
they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. Gimme a beat that sound\
like Jay-Z. You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them\
these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll\
be like, yo but I rap too. Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy\
'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever\
Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they\
didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked\
with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the\
company that'll say naw. Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my\
nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man\
[Jessica:] Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\
I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up\
Y'all niggaz is stupid. Let's just say I didn't get my deal.\
The nigga that was behind me, I mean,\
he wasn't even a nigga, you know?\
The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol\
Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.\
[Joe:] We gonna change the game, buddy.\
Dame was like, yo you got a deal with Capitol,\
okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\
[Dame:] you gotta make sure it's not wack.\
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to\
play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and\
Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll\
never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\
I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now\
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So\
I play that song for him, and he's like oh shit\
[Dame:] Oh shit it's not even wack.\
I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\
[Dame:] it's actually kinda hot.\
Like they still weren't looking at me\
like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole\
album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and\
save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's\
like yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick\
[Dame:] you don't wanna catch a brick\
You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\
I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, oh, word? Actually, even with\
that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was\
already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you\
know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I\
was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm\
not gonna name no names, but people told me, oh he's just a producer\
rapper and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--\
the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do\
man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio\
sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes\
man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said\
yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\
[Mel:] Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\
And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested\
and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying\
to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I\
called G, I said, man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"

Take 'em back to the plan...\
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.\
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,\
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.\
Let's take 'em back to the club.\
Least about an hour I would stand on line,\
I just wanted to dance.\
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.\
I just wanted to shine.\
Jay's favorite line: Dog, in due time\
Now he look at me, like Damn, dog, you where I am\
A hip hop legend.\

You go out to eat, he can't pay y'all can't leave\
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves\
But why y'all washing watch him\
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun\
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes\
This week he mopping floors, next week it's the fries\

Hit the freeway go at least bout 80\
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby\
See back back then then if you had a car\
You were the Chi town version of Baby\
And I was just a virgin a baby\
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy\
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked\

Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes\
It's a star-studded event when I valet park\
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark\

The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm balling\
I'm leaning on a switch sitting crooked in my slab\
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab\
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla\
Riding some candy coated crawling like a caterpillar\
I'm tipping on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw\
I'm looking for them hoes baby what it do?\
Drive slow homey\
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes\
Drive slow homey\
If you riding around the city with nowhere to go\

I got more TV's in here then where I live\
And it don't make no sense but baby I'm the shit\
And everything I flip you know is something serious\
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims\
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident\
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced\
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit\
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain\
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings\
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king\
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green\
My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues\
My cylinder quiet like tip toes\

He claim my heart can't take the anastesia\
It'll send her body into a seizure\
The little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beeping,\
Hey chick, im at a lost for words\
What do you say at this time?\
Remember when I was nine?\
Tell her everything gone be fine?\
But i'd be lying, the family crying\
They want her to live, and she trying\
I'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we fly in\
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid,\
If Magic Johnson got a cure for A.I.D.S.\
And all the broke muthafuckers past away\
You tellin me if my grandma was in the N.B.A.\
Right now she'd be ok?\
But since she was just a secretary\
Working for the church\
For thirty five years\
Things sposed to stop right here\
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong,\
Thats where I get my confidence from\
I asked the nurse did you do the research?\
She ask me, can you sign some t-shirts?\
Bitch is you smokin reefer?\

Wow, one day, they tried to bring me down\

We're going to mass today, we have to pray\
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say\
Since Pac passed away\
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me\
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything\
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream\
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is\
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids\
But they're gonna have to take my life 'fore they take my drive\
'cause when I was barely living, that's what kept me alive\
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time\
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind\
And get some lee way on the he say she say\
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay\
Spanish girls say No hable inglés\
And everybody want to run to me for their single\
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help\
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself\
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself\
Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself\
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself\
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help\
Now I'll speak from the heart, you all fronting\
Everybody feel a way about K but at least you all feel something\
Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you\
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way\

There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose\
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose\

Vegas on acid,\
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses\
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz\
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does\
he write his own rhymes, so sort of\
I think 'em\
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up\
Damn, is he really that caught up?\
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?\
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder\
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche\
- its for yourself that's important\
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men\
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan\
Excuse me,\
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because\

Couldn't nobody cure me\
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry\
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them\
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them\
What more can you ask for?\
The international assholes nah\
Who complains about what he is owed?\
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old\
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul\
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,\
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane\
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name\
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane\
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown\
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown\
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down\
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down\
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)\
My father Ben said I need Jesus\
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser\
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)\
The preacher said we need leaders\
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic\
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it\
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it\
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic\
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic\
After debris settles and the dust get swept off\
Big K pick up where young Hov left off\
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off\
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of\
A&R's lookin' like pssh we messed up\
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up\
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up\
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up\
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back\
That'll be the same day I give the game back\
You know the next question dog Yo, where Dame at?\
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back\
What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?\
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen\
R-r-r-right here stands a-man\
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...\

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\

Turn nothin to something now pimpin' that's a savior\
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper\
High off the ground instead of skyscraper\
Cool off thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major\
We major (come on, homie, we major) [repeat]\
Feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon\
Better than a chick that say yes to soon\
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma\
And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.\
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up\
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up\
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?\
Get they first car and then IRS show up\
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine\
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine\
Put two and two together in a little bad weather\
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line\
Ask the reverand was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school\
That's all I want like wino's want they good whisky\
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me\
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write\
First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?\
Four-four's or black christ? Both flows would be nice\
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight\
At the studio consol asked my man to the right\
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?\
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic\
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel\
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed\
Now I'm a free agent\
And I'm thinking it's time\
To build my very own Motown\
Cuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s\
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life\
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic\
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt\
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed\
I survived the livest niggas around\
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns\
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took\
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.\
Feeling better than I ever felt before today\
Like better late than never is orientation\
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away"

Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold\
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul\
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?\
You work late nights just to keep on the lights\
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike\
And you would give anything in this world\
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl\
And you never put no man over me\
And I love you for that mommy cant you see?\
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes\
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry\
As we knelt on the kitchen floor\
I said mommy Imma love you till you don't hurt no more\
And when I'm older, you aint gotta work no more\
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford\
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable\
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot\

Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)\

Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with\
But still supported me when I did the opposite\
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get\
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you\
You was getting through, can the choir please\
Give me a verse of You, Are So Beautiful To Me\
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry\
Maya Angelou, Nicky Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy\
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet\
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)\
I guess it also depends tho, if my ends low\
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo\
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)\
Tell your job you gotta fake em out\
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out\
To a restaurant, upper echelon\
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want\

Homie, this shit is basic\
Welcome to graduation\
Good morning\

On this day we become legendary\
Everything we dreamed of\
I'm like a fly Malcolm X\
Buy any jeans necessary\
Detroit Red cleaned up\
From the streets of the league\
From an eighth to a key\
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets\
From the moments of pain\
Look how far we done came\
Haters saying ya changed\
Now ya doing ya thing\
Good morning\
Good morning\
Good morning\
Good morning\
Good morning\
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future\
While I hop in the Delorean\
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student\
Some people graduate, but we still stupid\
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around\
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus\
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness\
After all of that, you receive this\
Good morning\
Hustlers, that's if you're still living\
Get on down\

Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib\
Just a little somethin' show you how we live\
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious\
That's that shit\
So if you're gonna do it, do it just like this\
(Did you realize\
That you were a champion?\
In their eyes)\
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?\
You don't see just how fly my style is?\
I don't see why I need a stylist\
When I shop so much I can speak Italian\
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids\
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects\
But everytime I want it, layaway or a deposit\
My dad'll say When you see clothes close your eyelids\
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son\
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones\
'cause every summer he'll get some\
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from\
And I don't know what he did for dough\
But he'd sent me back to school with a new wardrobe and hey!\
When it feel like living's harder than dyin'\
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'\
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion\
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'\
'cause who the kids gonna listen to? Huh?\
I guess me if it isn't you\
Last week I paid a visit to the institute\
They got the Drop Out keepin' kids in the school\
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do\
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle\
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems\
Like I dropped out of P.E.\
They used to feel invisible\
Now they know they invincible\

That you were a champion?\

This is the story of a champion\
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns\
Stand up stand up! Here he comes\
Tell me what it takes to be number one?\
Tell me what it takes to be number one?\

You just trying to find where the tissue is\
You can still be who you wish you is\
It ain't happen yet\
And that's what the intuition is\
When you hop back in the car\
Drive back to the crib\
Run back to their arms\
The smokescreens\
The chokes and the screams\
You ever wonder what it all really mean\
And I wonder if you know\
What it means, what it means\
And I wonder if you know\

And I'm back on my grind\
A psychic read my lifeline\
Told me in my lifetime\
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline\
And that's what I'm\
Seven o'clock, that's primetime\
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hot lines\
Why he keep giving me hot lines\
I'm a star, how could I not shine\
How many ladies in the house\
How many ladies in the house without a spouse\
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused\

But when I get my card back activated\
I'm back to Vegas cause\
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it\
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life\

Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.\
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,\
and what I do? Act more stupidly.\

The drama, people suing me,\
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.\

So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways\
Old folks talking about back in my day\
But homey this is my day.\
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?\
You know I already graduated\
And you can live through anything if magic made it.\
They say I talk with so much emphasis,\
Oh, they're so sensitive.\
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen\
Say something were you gone end up apologising.\
Let me know if it's a problem man,\
Alright man, holla then.\
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,\
Let that man get past.\
You don't need a stop to get gas,\
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cause\
How he move in a room full of no's?\
How he stay faithful in a room full of h**s?\
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,\
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.\
Treasure. What's you pleasure?\
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.\
So if the devil wear Prada,\
Adam Eve wear Nada,\
I'm in between, but way more fresher.\
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,\
That's when you die hard.\

She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em\
When you meet me in person what does it feel like\
I know, I know I look better in real life\
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot\
You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot\
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG\

And you say Chi city,\
Chi city, Chi city\
I'm coming home again.\
Do you think about me now and then?\
Do you think about me now and then?\
Cause I'm coming home again\
I'm in home again.\
I met this girl when I was three years old\
And what I loved most she had so much soul\
She said, excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me- but,\
My name is Windy and, I like to blow trees and,\
From that point I never blow her off,\
They can come from outta town I like to show her off,\
They like to act tough, she like to tow em off,\
And make em straighten up their act, cause she know they soft\
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown\
And at nighttime my face lit up so astounding\
And I told her in my heart is where she always be\
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave\
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me\
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me\
I guess it's why last winter she got so cold on me\
She said, Ye keep making that, keep making that platinum and gold for me\
Do you think about me now and then?\
Do you think about me now and then?\
Cause I'm coming home again\
I'm in home again\
Do you think about me now and then?\
Do you think about me now and then?\
Oh, now I'm coming home again\
Maybe we can start again\
But if you really care for her, then you would n-never hit the airport,\
To follow your dream, sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her\
It always seems like she talking about me,\
She said you left your kids and they just like you\
They wanna rap and make show beats just like you,\
But they just not you and I just got through\
Talking bout what she can try to do just not new\
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong\
I guess you never know what you got till its gone\
I guess this is why I'm here and I cant come back home\
And guess when I heard that when I was back home\
Every interview I'm representing you making you proud\
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud\
Jump in the crowd, spark you lighters, wave em around,\
And if you don't know by now, I'm talking about Chi Town,\
Do you think about me now and then?\
Do you think about me now and then?\
Cause I'm coming home again\
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan\
Oh, now I'm coming home again\
I'm in home again\
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan\
Oh, now I'm coming home again\
Maybe we can start again\
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh\

My big brother was Big's brother\
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother\
Who was hip hop brother\
Who was No I.D friend\
No I.D My mentor\
Now let the story begin\
Its the hard knock life tour\
Sell out, picture us in the mall\
Coping iceberg and yell out Jigga\
Yea that's what we would yell out\
Yell out\
You know the name dude\
I gotta spell out or tell bout\
J a y an Ye so shy\
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi\
Standing there like a mime\
Let the chance pass by\
Back of my mind he could change your life\
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it\
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig\
But he got me out my mama crib\
Then he help me get my mama a crib\
Big brother was Bigs Brother\
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother\
Who was hip hop brother\
Who was No I.D friend\
No I.D my mentor\
Now let the story begin\
Let the story begin\
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands\
Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline\
Nothing handed out\
I'm about to take mine\
Around the same time of that BluePrint 1\
Any beats in my pocket was that Blueprint form\
I'd play my little song in that old back room\
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you\
But by the Black album I was blacking out\
Party at S.O.Bs and we had packed the crowd\
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square\
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there\
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it\
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets\
I guess big brother was thinking a little different\
Kept little brother at bay, at a distance\
Put everything I felt was more focused\
Only made me more focused\
Only wrote more potent\
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over\
I guess ill understand when I get more older\
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the todum\
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrodum\
My big Brother was Bigs brother\
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother\
Who was hip hops brother\
Who was No I.Ds friend\
No I.D my mentor\
Now let the story begin\
Begin\
Let the story begin\
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands\
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant\
Not only a client the presidito\
Hola ovito\
The game getting foul so here's a free throw\
I was always on the other side of the peep hole\
Then I dropped Jesus walks now I'm on a steep hole\
And we know\
New jack city gotta keep my brother\
But to be number 1 I'm a beat my brother\
On that diamond remix I swore I spaz\
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass\
Sibling rivery, only I could see\
It was the pride in me that was driving me\
At the Grammies I said I inspired me\
But my big brother who I always tried to be\
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll\
Cause even if he gave me the rock its give and go\
I guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk\
And my shit was more like a finger roll\
but I had them singles though\
And them hoes at the show gonna minggle yo.\
Ya know\
I told Jay I did a song with cold play\
Next thing I know he got a song with coldplay\
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way\
Translate espanol\
No way Jose\
Then I went and told Jay brown\
Should of known that was gonna come back around\
Should of told you like a man should of told you first\
But I told somebody else that's what made shit worse\
My big brother was Bigs brother\
So here's a few words from your kid brother\
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um\
People never get the flowers while they could smell um\
A ideal in my eyes, God of the game\
Heart of the city,Rockafella chain\
Never be the same, never be another\
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother\
My big Brother was Bigs brother\
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother\
Who was hip hops brother\
Who was No I.Ds friend\
No I.D my mentor\
And that's where the story ends\

How could you be so cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo\

Ayo, I know there are some things that you ain't told me\
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me\
And now you wanna get me back and you gonna show me\
So you walk around like you don't know me\
You got a new friend, well I got homies\
But in the end it's still so lonely\
How could you be so Dr. Evil?\
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know\

Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?\
Why would she be so mad at me for?\
Homie I don't know she's hot and cold\
I won't stop wont mess my groove up\
Cause I already know how this thing go\
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me\
They say that they don't see what you see in me\
You wait a couple months then you gonna see\
You'll never find nobody better than me\
Talking talking talking talk\

Wise men say\
The baddest niggas out there bro\
Never figure out real love\
You'll never figure out real love\
You'll never figure out real love\
Its so crazy\
I got everything figured out\
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about\
No doubt\
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what real love is about\
Do you think I sacrificed real life\
For all the fame of flashing lights?\
Do you think I sacrifice a real life\
For all the fame of flashing lights?\
There is no Gucci I can buy\
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on\
There is no YSL that they could sell\
To get my heart out of this hell\
And my mind out of this jail\
There is no clothes that I could buy\
That could turn back the time\
There is no vacation spot I could fly\
That could bring back a piece of real life\
Real life, what does it feel like?\
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight\
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight\
To live a real life\
I just want to be a real boy\
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy\
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy\
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy\
Its funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it\
I tell the truth and I keep running\
Its like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something\
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing\
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?\
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel\
Do you really have the stamina...\
For everybody that sees you and that say 'where's my camera?'\
For everybody that sees you and says 'sign my autograph'\
For everybody that sees you and says that 'you all that'\
You all that\
I just want to be a real boy,\
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy\
Pinocchio story goes...\
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me\
The only one was behind me I cant find her no more,\
I cant find her no more I cant...\
the only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...\
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream\
And the fame will be got caught\
And the day I moved to LA\
Maybe that was all my fault\
All my fault to be a real boy\
Chasing the American dream,\
Chasing everything we seen\
Up on the TV screen\
And when I- the Benz was left\
And the clothes was left\
And the hoes was left\
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-\
You spent the doughs to death\
And tell me what-tf for a real boy\
They say Kanye you keep it too real boy\
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way\
The wise man say, you'll find your way\

and refresh the page and restart the memory?\
respark the soul and rebuild the energy?\
we stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies\
sorry for the night demons still visit me\
the plan was to drink until the pain over\
but what’s worse, the pain or the hangover?\
fresh air, rolling down the window\
too many Urkels on your team, that’s why your wins low\
don’t make me pull the toys out, huh\
don’t make me pull the toys\
and fire up the engines\
and then they make noooise\
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)\

At the mall there was a seance\
just kids, no parents\
then the sky filled with heron\

And the hell, it wouldn’t spare us\

they rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday\
and what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach\
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach\
but God said I need a different approach\
cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke\
its not funny anymore try different jokes\
tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o\
kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it\
play strings for the dramatic\

steam about a hundred and one L's\
kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson\
nigga hat game was special\
it matched every black pair of Nikes\
throwing dice for decimals\
the older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head\
make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead\
got made code red\
break up the black skunk\
the black dutch, back of the old shed\
if you can't live, you dying\
you give or buy in\
keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding\
keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan\
learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye\

two hands in the air if you don’t really care\
it’s like that sometimes I mean ridiculous\
it’s like that sometimes the shit’s ridiculous\
One hand in the air if you don’t really care\
middle finger in the air if you don’t really care\
it’s like that sometimes, man ridiculous\

I love it though\
Uh put your hands to the constellations\
they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation\
I know I’m preaching to the congregation\
we love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan\
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting\
we ain't married but tonight I need some consummation\
may the Lord forgive us\
may the God’s be with us\
and that magic hour I seen good Christians make rash decisions\
oh she do it, what happened to Religion?\
oh she lose it\
she putting on her make up\
she casually allure\
text message break up, the casualty of tour\
how she gone wake up and not love me no more\
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it’s rubbing off\
hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme\
hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron\
I’m looking at her like this what you really want it, huh?\
what we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime\
Uh put your hands to the constellations\
they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation\
I know I’m preaching to the congregation\
we love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan (Satan, Satan, Satan)\
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting\
we ain't married but tonight I need some consummation\
When the sun go down its the magic hour\
the magic hour\
and outta all the colours that are still up the skies\
you got green on your mind\
I can see it in your eyes\
why you standing there with your face screwed up\
don’t leave while your hot that’s how Mase screwed up\
throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up\
maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us\
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat\
I ordered you jerk, she said you are what you eat\
you see I always loved your sense of humour\
but tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was\
the Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie\
the crib scarface couldn’t be more Tony\
you love me for me could you be more phoney\
Uh put your hands to the constellations\
they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation\
haven’t said a word, haven’t said a word\
to me this evening\
Cat got your tongue?\
Lookin’ at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone\
Lookin’ at my wrist it’ll turn your ass to stone\
Stretch limousine, sippin’ Rosé all along\
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own\
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character\
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender\
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders\
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired\
Before his jaw shattered climbin’ up the Lord’s ladder\
We still speedin’, runnin’ signs like they don’t matter\
Uh, hater talkin’ never made me mad\
Never that when I’m in my favorite papertag\
Therefore G4s at the Clearport\
When it come to tools, fool I’m a Pep Boy\
When it came to dope, I was quick to export\
Never tired of ballin’ so it’s on to the next sport\
New Mercedes sedan, they’ll export\
So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud\
Different traps, I was gettin’ mail from\
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne\
Whole clique, appetite had tapeworms\
Spinnin’ Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns\
I shed a tear before the night's over\
God bless the man I put this ice over\
Gettin’ 2Pac money twice over\
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller\
I’m makin’ love to the angel of death\
Catchin’ feelings, never stumble, retracin’ my steps"

Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet\

Tell me when you think we crossed the line\
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need\
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life\
Never in your wildest dreams, never in your wildest dreams\
In your wildest\
You could hear the loudest screams, comin' from inside the screen\
You a wild bitch\
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy\
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy\
Or do anal, or do a gangbang\
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing\
Well I guess alotta niggas do gang bang\
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang\
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang\
Bang bang bang bang bang\

No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need\
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life\
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star\
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard\
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids\
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bride's maid\
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over\
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja\
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day\
'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de\
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her they couldn't take the shame\
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, Get away.\
How could you say they live they life wrong?\
When you never fuck with the lights on\
Have you lost your mind\
Tell me when you think we crossed the line\
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need\
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life\

And got married in a bathroom\
Honeymoon on the dance floor\
And got divorced by the end of the night\

I'll call you bitch for short as a last resort and my first result.\
You call me motherfucker for long,\
At the end of it you know we both were wrong.\

On a bathroom wall I wrote\
I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else (else, else, else)\
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and I went and found somebody else\
Fuck arguing or harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my fucking self\
Till about 2am and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself\
Somebody help\
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it\
Stick around, real feelings might surface\
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up fuckin and choking you\
What the hell was I supposed to do\
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude\
And if you are I hope you are have a good time\
Cause I definitely be having mine\
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional\
Every time I hear bout other nigga's stroking you\
Might say I hit you\
He sitting there consoling you\
Runnin my name through the mud\
Who's provoking you\
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you\
Now you noticeable and cant nobody can control you\
1 A.M. and can't nobody get a hold of you\
I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do\
Even though I knew, he never told the truth\
He was just gon say whatever you gon told him too\
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions\
Chuck dirt on eachother like mud wrestlers\
I heard he bought some coke with my money\
Dat aint right girl\
You getting blackmailed for that white girl\
You always said Yeezy I ain't you're right girl\
Probably find one of them I like art type girls\
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl\
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie\
And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame\
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained\
Let's play the blame game...\
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more\
Let's play the blame game for sure.\
Things used to be, now they not\
Anything but us is who we are\
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers\
We've become public enemies\
We walk away like strangers in the street\
Gone for eternity\
We erased one another\
So far from where we came\
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing\
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E\
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely\
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more\
Let's play the blame game for sure.\
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more.\
Let's call out names, names, for sure.\
I can't love you this much\
I can't love you this much\
I can't love you this much\
I can't love you this much\
No, I can't love you this much\
I can't love you this much\
And I know that you are somehwere doing your thing\
And when the phone called it just ring and ring\
You aint pick up but your phone accidently called me back\
And I heard the whole thing.\
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing...\
Ohh my God..\
Baby you done took this shit to another motherfucking level\
Now a neighbourhood nigga like me aint supposed to be gettin no pussy like this\
Damn, Damn! Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?\
(Yeezy taught me)\
You never used to talk dirty, but now you got damn disgusting,\
My, my God, where'd you learn that?\
(Yeezy taught me)\
Look at you motherfucking butt ass naked with these motherfucking Jimmy Choos off\
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?\

Yo you took your game up a whole 'nother level, this is some Cirque 'u Soleil now!\
You done went all porno on it, k. And I, and I love it..\
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!\
How did you learn, how.. how did your game come up?\

I was fucking parts of your pussy I never fuck before\
I was in there like oo I never been here before. I've never even seen this part of town before.\
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or something. What the fuck happened?\
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?\
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)\
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy.\
And when I see that nigga Imma thank him.\
Imma buy his album, Imma download that.. Imma shoot a bootlegger!\
That's how good I feel about this nigga\
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch. This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted\
Even with the bezel this is the motherfucker I wanted. I saw this shit, I saw it\
Twista had this shit on in The Source. I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source\
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!\
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?\

Down for a night, down for a good time\
Us living as we do upside down.\
And the new word to have is revolution.\
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.\
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.\
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.\
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.\
The signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.\
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal.\
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.\
America was a bastard, the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.\
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling in the mother country's crotch\
What does Webster say about soul?\
All I want is a good home and a wife\
And our children and some food to feed them every night.\
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.\
