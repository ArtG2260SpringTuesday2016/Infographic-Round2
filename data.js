We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25 Joke's on you, we still alive Throw your hands up in the sky and say: We don't care what people say If this is your first time hearin' this You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man Flickin' Starter coats, man Man, you don't know, man We don't care what people say This is for my niggas outside all winter Cause this summer they ain't finna say: next summer I'm finna Sittin' in the hood like community colleges This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55 And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up We put shit on layaway, then come back We claim other people kids on our income tax We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid And we don't care what people say Momma say she wanna move South Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house 'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work He figured he'd take work The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake And we don't care what people say You know the kids gon' act a fool When you stop the programs for after school And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic They favorite 50 Cent song 12 Questions We scream: rocks, blow, weed, park, see, now we smart We ain't retards, the way teachers thought Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class Sad enough we on welfare They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us But we don't care what people say My niggas"

Then I spent 400 bucks on this Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this! And I can't even go to the grocery store Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team It seems we living the american dream But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem The prettiest people do the ugliest things For the road to riches and diamond rings We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us We trying to buy back our 40 acres And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em Things we buy to cover up what's inside Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth That's why shortys hollering where the ballas' at? Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack And a white man get paid off of all of that But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou Before I had a house and I'd do it again Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific I got a problem with spending before I get it We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down"

        lyrics: "Some glad morning when this life is over, I'll fly away. To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away. I'll fly away, O Glory, I'll fly away. When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye, I'll fly away. When the shadows of this life have flown, I'll fly away. Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm, I'll fly away. I'll fly away, O Glory, I'll fly away. When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye, I'll fly away. Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away. To a land where joy shall never end, I'll fly away. I'll fly away, O Glory, I'll fly away. When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye, I'll fly away."
