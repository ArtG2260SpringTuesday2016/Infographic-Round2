- I couldn't figure out how to shift the graph over so I had to use filler blank data as a work around

- I'm not sure what the best way to show "0" on the graph would be, but I think it's necessary to have

- I kind of want to make it so the color changes as the graph goes along, but I didn't know how to do that

- I possibly want to make it so when you hover over it you have the date show up. I might just add the date underneath them too.
